# Euclid21

This is a mirror of the Java code from ["Euclid21: Euclid's Elements for the 21st Century - What We Have Wrought"](https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/euclid21-euclids-elements-for-the-21st-century-what-we-have-wrought)

A simple `Makefile` was added to build the `Euclid21.jar` which can then be used to run the app. Note the JAR depends on the `Data` folder to be relative to it.
